Hello! 
Welcome

Git v2.49 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * Completion script updates for zsh

 * "git pack-objects" and its wrapper "git repack" learned an option
   to use an alternative path-hash function to improve delta-base
   selection to produce a packfile with deeper history than window
   size.

 * "git gc" learned the "--expire-to" option and passes it down to
   underlying "git repack".

 * "[help] autocorrect = 1" used to be a way to say "please wait for
   0.1 second after suggesting a typofix of the command name before
   running that command"; now it means "yes, if there is a plausible
   typofix for the command name, please run it immediately".

  Modifying file to understand timestamp in git central repository
